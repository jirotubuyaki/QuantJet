# Quant Lightning  
## Intelligence Algorithm Trade Engine

## Vision  
QuantLightning is an open source library for algorithm trade system in the stock market. we plan to develop the infrastructure of intelligence trade engine and several artificial intelligence trade strategies. We use C++ ad Boost C++ Library. License is MIT Licence.

Alpha is investment strategy's ability to gain profit in the stock martket. It is built by lots of data and Machine Learning Technologies.We conduct signals that are timing to sell or buy aseet from alphas and prepare sell and buy algorithms. The many  scientific strategies of imvestments are proposed. We plan to implement the several strategies.  

## Contribution  
The QuantLightning project welcome developers. Please see my Github pages.
